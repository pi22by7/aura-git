  <h1>Returning Goods</h1>
  <p>You are responsible for the cost and risk of returning the Goods to Us. You should send the Goods at the following address:</p>
  <ul>

  </ul>
  <p>We cannot be held responsible for Goods damaged or lost in return shipment. Therefore, We recommend an insured and trackable mail service. We are unable to issue a refund without actual receipt of the Goods or proof of received return delivery.</p>
  <h1>Gifts</h1>
  <p>If the Goods were marked as a gift when purchased and then shipped directly to you, You'll receive a gift credit for the value of your return. Once the returned product is received, a gift certificate will be mailed to You.</p>
  <p>If the Goods weren't marked as a gift when purchased, or the gift giver had the Order shipped to themselves to give it to You later, We will send the refund to the gift giver.</p>
